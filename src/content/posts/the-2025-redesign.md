I rarely go a year with the same design, and I feel like I've learned so much about design this year - creating my own projects, working for <a href="https://www.ranova.ai">Ranova.ai</a>, and now starting at <a href="https://www.intracta.com">Intracta</a>. My old design was great, but it was time for something clean and fresh!

This whole design came from a Palette of red, green, grey and pink, which look like they might belong in a vintage Italian poster. It works very well with a clean, modern layout! The font is still Radio Canada, but I changed the headers to Oleo Script, and added a fun logo font. The logo is actually just a subset of PressStart2P, created with only those letters.

I've also pushed through a handful of small but meaningful updates to the site that address some visual inconsistencies and polish issues I've been noticing. Things like the "Today I found..." list, which never looked great on mobile.

The design generally uses modern fluid typography and layouts, so it will grow and shrink with the browser window size.

I guess any personal site is a work in progress... I have a few more ideas I'm tossing around for formatting and content. But this works for me right now!
