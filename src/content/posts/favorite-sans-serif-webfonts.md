Here are my 5 of my favorite free typefaces for websites at the moment, in no particular order. All are good for dealing with different styles and are available for free.

### Radio Canada

CBC/Radio-Canada is Canada's national public broadcaster, and they had this font designed by Charles Dauad in 2017. While ultra-readable and friendly-looking, it’s an underused option. My website, yakbrother.dev, uses it for all content. I just love the little details like the angled tops of the <strong>l</strong> and <strong>t</strong>.

### Karla

This is a modern Arial-like font, very readable and impressionable. I use it for my resume, and some older versions of this site. A few years ago it was very trendy, but it’s still great.

### iAWriter Quattro S

This is based on an IBM font but is mostly recognizable from the writing program writer. I love it because it looks friendly yet technical, especially the zeros. I use it for my creative writing blog, <a href="https://mostlytrue.life">Mostly True</a>, which adds to the type of stories I tell.

### Poppins

Another trendy font right now on the web, Poppins gives a nice, rounded, open feel. You can’t go wrong with this one for a user-friendly, readable font for your business site with this.

### Space Grotesk

This one makes me feel like a 1980s Lego astronaut (I really need a Halloween costume of that). It’s great for that retro-futuristic feel for tech writing or products. All it needs is something like [Moonspace](https://elements.envato.com/moonspace-tech-futuristic-font-ZHEXR4H) for the titling.
