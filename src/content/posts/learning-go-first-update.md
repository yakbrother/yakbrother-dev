One of the problems I discovered since [my last post](/posts/learning-go-from-a-hospital-bed/) is this: as a life-long programmer, it can be a little tough to learn a new language from scratch. After going through a few video tutorials on YouTube, Udemy, and ZTM, I leaned the basic types, syntax, and theory, but then I quickly tired of the projects. I actually wanted to argue about their structure, the same that I would do if I were planning a new feature at work. Some tutorials just annoyed me.

Obviously I needed something new if I really wanted to learn.

So what were my big advances in working on PHP? From what I remember, they were almost entirely learned while watching people code at conferences or work. Seeing someone’s problem-solving process, or watching them make mistakes and then need to fix them or refactor their code, was a lot like my own process at home and it resonated.

### So how to apply that with Go?

I learned you could watch people code on Youtube and Switch. I started putting together a list of people to watch.

- [@rwxrob](https://www.youtube.com/@rwxrob) has quite a few videos, some quite advanced, but some excellent for beginners who want to jump into coding. He starts a bit slow, but I like watching his mind work as he codes larger projects.

- [Golang Cafe](https://www.youtube.com/@GolangCafe) presents a series of problems and how they go about solving them; The Advent of Code is particularly good, but it looks like I could spend a lot of time here.

- [@justforfunc](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_BzFbxG2za3bp5NRRRXJSw) has a number of interesting looking videos to browse also - they’re a bit shorter and more targeted.

These are my start. I also found a [repository on test-driven design with go](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests), and looking over that is helping me with a few questions I had.

Each of these begin to open their own set of doors, so... Time to buckle down and keep going!
