# About Me

---

Welcome! I created this site to showcase my work as I explore new opportunities in Switzerland, and to share my ongoing projects and thoughts about design and development. I've been a computer programmer since childhood, when my dad taught me how to build motherboards and play with MSDOS scripts and Visual Basic. Since then, I've worked as a professional developer for almost 20 years.

Code has as almost mystical sense of fun for me, whether I'm designing something or helping someone else realize their idea. For this reason I keep ending up coding "the hard way". I like writing my own HTML, CSS, and Javascript, not using libraries or frameworks - and I like using Vim or Sublime Text (or Windows Notebook in the old days) instead of an IDE. I'm not a purist by any means - I just love a beautiful HTML document. There's something deeply satisfying about crafting clean, efficient code that works exactly as intended, without any extra layers.

Beyond coding, both music and travel shape my life. I love making friends across cultures and learning their stories, especially when it involves playing my mandolin or ukulele around a campfire with new friends. This love of different perspectives eventually led me to Switzerland, where I now live with my brilliant wife - and two cats (whose evil-to-cuteness ratio fluctuates dramatically from moment to moment).

I'm always open to chat with other programmers, designers, and musicians. If you happen to live in the Nyon/Lausanne area, and would like to meet up, I'd be happy to make a new friend! Email me at <a href="mailto:tim@yakbrother.dev">tim@yakbrother.dev</a>.
