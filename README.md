## Colors

The colors were chosen using several tools to insure accessibility and contrast. The colors are all set using variables for dark and light in the global.css file. Personally, I created the palletes and gradients using these tools:

- https://colorfly.io/
- https://www.learnui.design/tools/accessible-color-generator.html
- https://colorffy.com/mesh-gradient-generator (for the background gradient)
