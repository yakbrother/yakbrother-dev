# Yakbrother.dev - Personal Website Theme

A clean and modern personal website theme built with Astro, using fluid type and grid sizing for smooth size transitions.

## Features

- Responsive design
- Clean and minimal
- Fluid typography
- Microblog for found links (Today I Found...)
- Blog for personal projects

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Customization

- Edit pages in `src/pages/`
- Modify the layout in `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
- Update styles in the respective component files
- Make your own favicons with https://realfavicongenerator.net/

## Colors

The colors were chosen using several tools to insure accessibility and contrast. The colors are all set using variables for dark and light in the global.css file. Personally, I created the palletes and gradients using these tools:

- https://colorfly.io/
- https://www.learnui.design/tools/accessible-color-generator.html

## CSS

- Made using principles from CUBE and Utopia.fyi, with a liberal sprinkling of Picalilly articles I've read over time.
